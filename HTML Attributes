HTML Attributes are special words used within the opening tag of an HTML element. They provide additional information about HTML elements. 
HTML attributes are used to configure and adjust the element's behaviour, appearance, or functionality in a variety of ways.

Each attribute has a name and a value, formatted as name="value".
Attributes tell the browser how to render the element or how it should behave during user interactions.
