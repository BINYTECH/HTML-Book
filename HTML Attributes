HTML Attributes are special words used within the opening tag of an HTML element. They provide additional information about HTML elements. 
HTML attributes are used to configure and adjust the element's behaviour, appearance, or functionality in a variety of ways.

Each attribute has a name and a value, formatted as name="value".
Attributes tell the browser how to render the element or how it should behave during user interactions.

The src Attribute
The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed:

<img src="img_girl.jpg">

There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:

1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".

Notes: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it, you may be in violation of copyright laws. 
In addition, you cannot control external images; it can suddenly be removed or changed.

2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. 
If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg". 
If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".


The width and height Attributes
The <img> tag should also contain the width and height attributes, which specify the width and height of the image (in pixels):

Example
<img src="img_girl.jpg" width="500" height="600">

The alt Attribute
The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. This can be due to a slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.

Example
<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl with a jacket">
